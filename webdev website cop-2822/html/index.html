		<p> Hello everyone, I hope you can see the picture of myself up there. It is not a very good one but it will have to do. I took the picture on the observation deck from the Empire State Building and it was very windy and cold. 
		This is my very FIRST Website. Obviously it is very basic. I am very excited about successfully uploading it to the internet.</p>
		
		<center><p>It's actually quite interesting. I am surprised to be writing in my text editor today (01/2016) because my PC got a virus last night and this morning i had to do an unistall and reinstall and I lost all my APP's and doc's. Very fustrating needless to say, although I have learned quite a bit in the meantime.</p></center>
		
		<center><p>I have been reading and searching on the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"> W3Schools!</a> website trying to gather so much info. My favorite web site or search engine is <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"> Google</a> & <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"> YouTube!!.</a></p></center>
		
		<center><p> I hope to get quite a bit from this experience, but most of all to have fun and enjoy it.  I am orignally from Orlando, Florida. I hope to stay here, but you never really know where life and a career will take you. There is a link to the start of my first blog below. I'm HAPPY its free. </p></center>
